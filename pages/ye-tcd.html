                            Kanye provides a commentary and personally introspects on the effects of consumerism in this challenging song.  Ye explores the perspective 
                            of a self-conscious young adult lost in a commercially driven lifestyle before admitting to his own insecurities that fuel his need to spend money to feel good about himself.  The observable 
                            consumerism in hip hop culture is also called out, making this track on Ye's freshman album a bold social meta-commentary that raised eyebrows of many in the industry.

                            The fourth single from the album was another powerful statement: a mainstream popular hip hop song centered around Christianity.
                            Pondering on the evils of the world, Ye unapologetically proclaims his need and worship of Christ, fully aware of the stigma
                            and dismissal with which religious motifs are often treated by pop culture.

                            Kanye's first commercial hit and #1 single, "Slow Jamz" is exactly that: a smooth jazz infused soulful groove displaying Kanye's
                            versatility in production.  Guest feature Jamie Foxx provides the sweet vocals on the chorus, while Twista takes the last verse to switch
                            up the pace with his characteristic speedy rap delivery.  Kanye also showed his comedic side while providng an all-time memorable line referencing another
                            famous popstar.

                            In a career defining song that characterizes Kanye's unrelenting grit and determination to make it in the rap game,
                            Ye tells the story of his near-fatal car crash that had just recently happened to him at the time.  He explains the 
                            reconstructive jaw surgery he underwent, and how even a scare with death could not stop him, clearly demonstrated as he was now -- even despite the metal headgear
                            he temporarily was wearing post-surgery -- literally rapping "through the wire".

                            The outro to <em>The College Dropout</em>, "Last Call" shows Kanye reminiscing on his life up to this point and 
                            telling the story of his upcoming in the rap industry.  The latter half of the extended song turns from rapping to narration 
                            as a humble and eager Kanye gives details on his grind.  This song is a fan favorite to many, as it the struggles a young Kanye
                            had to go through to make it in the game.
