                    incident and further influenced by his deteriorating relationship with model Amber Rose, 
                    My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a genre-bending masterpiece that explores the darker sides of celebrity, 
                    fame, and love. The album was widely acclaimed by both fans and critics; it received a near impossible 10/10 rating from Pitchfork 
                    Media and several of its songs (along with the record itself) 
                    appeared on numerous “best of 2010” lists, and the album won the 2012 Grammy for Best Rap Album." <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/My-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy">-Genius</a></p>

                            In a triumphantly beautiful opening sequence filled with angelic voices harmonizing and entrancing strings and keys, Ye's return to the
                            world was an echoing refrain of "Can we get much higher?" This heavenly intro switches sharply and suddenly into a much more serious stern piano beat, with Kanye
                            getting right to business with his verses.  An incredible blend of sound sets the stage for the critically acclaimed album.

                            A hit single from the album whose instrumental now serves as an instantly recognizable stadium chant, Power has been said by Kanye
                            to be his proof that he can make a perfect song.  Its blaring guitars and hard drums push the track as Kanye raps about social commentary, various drama he was involved in, 
                            and other themes related to socio-political power and influence.

                        <p class="song_description">
                            The song is about Kanye’s qualms living as a celebrity with personal problems in the public eye. 
                            He conveys this through the image of lights and the story of a troubled family – domestic abuse, imprisonment, 
                            separation/divorce etc. The song serves as a 
                            literal story of troubles in the home, and also as a metaphor for Kanye’s struggles with fame and his relation to hip-hop.

                            According to Kanye, the verse began as a poem he emailed to Kim Kardashian because he had the beat but no lyrics. 
                            He made the revelation at his Glastonbury 2015 headline set.
